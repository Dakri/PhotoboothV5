# Frontend built to ../public/frontend (via vite config we set earlier? Let's check)
# Vite config said: outDir: '../public/frontend' relative to frontend dir.
# So it should be in public/frontend already? No, vite config root is frontend/.
# So '../public/frontend' means 'photobooth/public/frontend'.
# Backend Main.go expects './public/frontend'.
# So dist structure should be:
# dist/
#   photobooth (binary)
#   public/
#     frontend/
#     legacy/
#   config/
#   scripts/

# Copy Frontend (already in public/frontend if vite config worked, but let's ensure)
# Actually, let's just copy from wherever vite put it. 
# Our Vite config was: outDir: '../public/frontend'.
# So running build in frontend/ puts files in photobooth/public/frontend.
# We want to move everything to dist/ for the release.
